I took a Program Structure course and in this class, we learned both C and C++ programming languages. In this class, we were assigned two projects. Both projects are the same, except for the language they are written in. The first project was written in C, while the second project was written in C++.

## What the Project is about
This project involves an interface where users are given the option to add, print all, find, or delete a record from the database. The data is stored in a database in the form of a linked list. 

Creating the same project in two languages was a great way to test our flexibility. Proj1 is where most of the work was done. Proj2 is a copy of proj1, but with some changes to allow it to compile with the C++ compiler

## Links to the project
