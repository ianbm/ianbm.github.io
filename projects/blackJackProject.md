Black Jack is a card game where each player receives two cards. Each card has a value: numbered cards have a value of 2-10; Jacks, Queens, and Kings have a value of 10; Aces have a value of either 1 or 11. The objective is for your cards to add up to 21 without exceeding that number. The player with cards that add up to 21 (or closest to 21 if nobody has 21) without exceeding 21 is the winner.

Intro to Comp Science I is the first of the programming courses that I've taken. In this course we learned the basics of programming and I learned my first programming language which was Java. We were assigned a final project which was to create an application using what we learned that semester. For my project, I chose to create a simulation of the game Black Jack.

This was my first programming project ever. It was a great way to practice my programming skills. The biggest takeaway from this project was input validation. I would probably say that input validation is one of the most important things to consider when creating an application.
