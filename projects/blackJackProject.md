summary: I created an application that simulates the card game Black Jack
---

Black Jack is a card game where each player receives two cards. Each card has a value: numbered cards have a value of 2-10; Jacks, Queens, and Kings have a value of 10; Aces have a value of either 1 or 11. The objective is for your cards to add up to 21 without exceeding that number.
