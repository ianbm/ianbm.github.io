summary: An application for the UH Manoa community to find surf spots or surf buddies

## What is Surf-Connect?
Surf-Connect is an app that helps UH students find surf spots or surf buddies. The two main features of Surf-Connect are the forecast and connect pages. The forecast page provides users with a list of beaches around Oahu along with updated information like the wave height, water temperature, and weather. The connect page allows displays other users with the same ability level or preferred time. This page is where users are able to connect with other users by sending them messages.

### Development of Surf-Connect
This project involved working in a group, which was interesting for me because it was my very first programming group project. We used GitHub's project board feature to organize all the work done for the project. For this project we split the work pretty evenly between our team members (3 people). Most of my contributions to this app are on the user side. I was mainly responsible for allowing users to create, edit, and delete their own profiles, and also getting users to display on the connect page.

### Takeaways from the Project
Since this was my first programming group project, I was nervous at first. I'm also a shy person, so that also added to the tension in the beginning. But in the end, I believe it was a great experience. Being able to work with others is an important skill for this career path. In my opinion, this is my most complete project because we were asked to actually deploy the app. This is something I've never actually done with my previous projects. Since this is the first project I've worked on which is on the internet and available for the world to see, it was very satisfying to see the finished product. One of the most interesting things about this experience was getting real people to try out our app. With this, we were able to find bugs and even fix a few of them.
