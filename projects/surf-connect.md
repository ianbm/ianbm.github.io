## What is Surf-Connect?
Surf-Connect is an app that helps UH students find surf spots or surf buddies. The two main features of Surf-Connect are the forecast and connect pages. The forecast page provides users with a list of beaches around Oahu along with updated information like the wave height, water temperature, and weather. The connect page allows displays other users with the same ability level or preferred time. This page is where users are able to 'connect' with other users by sending them messages.
