Fantasy Football is a game that many sports fans play. The concept in this game is to select football players every week, and based on how well they play during that week, you would gain "Fantasy Points." Whoever gets the most Fantasy Points by the end of the week is the winner of that week.

A few years ago I took a Database Systems class which covered topics like HTML, PHP, SQL, and Databases. We were assigned to create a website that takes input from users and stores the data in a database.

This was my first project using a database. It was also my first time using SQL and PHP. One of the main focuses of this class was security, and I learned how people are able to manipulate input boxes to 'hack' databases. To prevent these hacks, we had to check the user's input before connecting to the database.
