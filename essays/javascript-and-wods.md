Javascript is a lot easier to learn, compared to other languages that I have experience with. I took a web applications course at Honolulu Community College, where we briefly covered topics like HTML, Javascript, CSS, SQL, and PHP. This was a couple years ago, so I felt that the Intro to Javascript experience was very helpful in refreshing my memory. Although this was a great refresher, I also learned something new from this assignment, which were the keywords let and var. I have not seen these keywords used in other programming courses I have taken. Overall, I would say that Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective because it's simple.

Athletic software engineering is new to me. When I first read about the WODs, I thought that this was going to be a stressful class; but after trying the practice WODS, I can see how this could be an effective learning style. In my opinion, this method of learning probably involves more work, but it is a fun way to learn. The time limit and the way WODs are graded puts a lot of pressure on us. But when we try out the practice WODS and see that we are actually able to beat the DNF time, it is a great feeling. I think this learning style will work as long as I don't procrastinate and do the practice WODS.
