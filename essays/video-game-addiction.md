## The Nerd
I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I still have a Playstation 1 and a Super Nintendo sitting somewhere in my closet. These video game consoles are older than me. There is also an online game called 'Runescape' that I have played on and off since middle school. I will admit that I probably play too much video games.

## How I Got Into Technology
It's not just video games that interests me. I have a strong interest in technology in general. My parents are somewhat illiterate when it comes to technology. We didn't have internet service at home until I really needed it, starting in middle school. But, whether it was going to a friends house, or using a public network, I still found a way to get online. This is around the time I began playing Runescape. This game is one of the biggest reasons why I spent so much time on computers growing up.

So here I am today, studying Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The end goal is to become a video game developer. But I would be fine with any career that involves programming. I've been playing video games my entire life, so it's pretty cool to learn about how they're made.
