I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I still have a Playstation 1 and a Super Nintendo sitting somewhere in my closet. These video game consoles are older than me. There is also this online game called 'Runescape' that I have played on and off since middle school. I will admit that I probably play too much video games.....
