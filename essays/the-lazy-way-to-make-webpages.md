After using Semantic UI for a couple weeks, I have to say that UI frameworks are very helpful for website design. Although they can be complicated, there a few advantages to using a UI framework compared to using just play HTML and CSS. A couple of the main advantages that I've found through my own experience with Semantic UI are that they can save a lot of time, and that they make it easier to layout the elements of a webpage the way you want them.
## How UI frameworks can save time
Using just HTML and CSS, we have to define classes ourselves. For example, creating a div with the class "column" or "row" does nothing until you define the column classes like so:

<img src="/images/columnClass.png" width="200px">

With a UI framework, we can skip the defining part. We can use classes that are already defined by the framework. Then all we have left to do is the easy/fun part: changing the style. That makes designing a webpage a lot simpler and less tedious. It would also make the source code look cleaner since there are less classes that need to be defined.
## How UI frameworks help with layout
We created a page called BrowserHistory, first using only HTML and CSS, then with Semantic UI. Here are two screenshots: one of a page using just HTML and CSS, and the other using Semantic UI.

### HTML/CSS: 
<img src="/images/htmlCssPage.png" width="500px">


### Semantic UI: 
<img src="/images/semanticUIPage.png" width="500px">


For the page with just HTML and CSS, the three columns appeared to be centered for me, while I was creating it. The problem was that the layout of the columns changed when I maximized the page. For the Semantic UI page, the columns remained centered no matter what size the browser window was. The issue in the HTML/CSS page could probably be fixed, but that just seems like a lot more work that I would have to do.

Going back to the previous point on saving time, I don't see why I would want to play with the code to make the columns work with any window size when I could just easily use a UI Framework, which does all that work for me. Other than that, one other advantage I could say that UI Frameworks have over plain HTML and CSS is that they make pages look more professional (in my opinion).
